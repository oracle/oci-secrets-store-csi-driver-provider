# Odo Base Image Support used to configure yum:
# * pull rpms from artifactory by default and gpgcheck the repos that support it;
# * assume yes to all commands (no need to use '-y');
# * filter out all docs/man pages and languages except English;
# * exit non-zero to fail the image build if an rpm is missing from the repo.
