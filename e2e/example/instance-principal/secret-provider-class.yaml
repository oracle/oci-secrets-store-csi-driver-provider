# SecretProviderClass is a custom resource to provide driver configurations and
# provider-specific parameters to the CSI driver.
#
# On pod start and restart, the driver will communicate with the provider to retrieve the secret content
# from the external Secrets Store you have specified in the SecretProviderClass resource.
#
# For more information check: https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started/usage.html
#
# This SecretProviderClass is used as a reference example of how to configure the OCI Vault provider.
# Each SecretProviderClass enumerates secrets to mount into the pod.
# So, multiple SecretProviderClass resources could exist in a single Kubernetes cluster.
